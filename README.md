# Astrea ontology

Repository for collaborative edition of the Astrea ontology, which is available online [here](https://w3id.org/def/astrea#). 

This ontology models the mappings and translations between ontology  patterns and SHACL patterns, which are used in the [Astrea online tool](http://astrea.linkeddata.es/) to generate automatically SHACL shapes from OWL ontologies.
