# Astrea ontology

Repository for collaborative edition of the Astrea ontology. 

This ontology models the mappings and translations between ontology  patterns and SHACL patterns, which are used in the [Astrea online tool](http://astrea.linkeddata.es/) to generate automatically SHACL shapes from OWL ontologies.
